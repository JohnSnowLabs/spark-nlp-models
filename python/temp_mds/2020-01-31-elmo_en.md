## Description 
Computes contextualized word representations using character,based word representations and bidirectional LSTMs.,This model outputs fixed embeddings at each LSTM layer and a learnable aggregation of the 3 layers.,* `word_emb`: the character,based word representations with shape [batch_size, max_length, 512].  == word_emb,* `lstm_outputs1`: the first LSTM hidden state with shape [batch_size, max_length, 1024]. === lstm_outputs1,* `lstm_outputs2`: the second LSTM hidden state with shape [batch_size, max_length, 1024]. === lstm_outputs2,* `elmo`: the weighted sum of the 3 layers, where the weights are trainable. This tensor has shape [batch_size, max_length, 1024]  == elmo,The complex architecture achieves state of the art results on several benchmarks. Note that this is a very computationally expensive module compared to word embedding modules that only perform embedding lookups. The use of an accelerator is recommended.,The details are described in the paper "[Deep contextualized word representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365)".
