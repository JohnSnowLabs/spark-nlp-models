## Description

Models the set of clinical relations defined in the 2010 i2b2 relation challenge:

TrIP: A certain treatment has improved or cured a medical problem (eg, ‘infection resolved with antibiotic course’)

TrWP: A patient's medical problem has deteriorated or worsened because of or in spite of a treatment being administered (eg, ‘the tumor was growing despite the drain’)

TrCP: A treatment caused a medical problem (eg, ‘penicillin causes a rash’)

TrAP: A treatment administered for a medical problem (eg, ‘Dexamphetamine for narcolepsy’)

TrNAP: The administration of a treatment was avoided because of a medical problem (eg, ‘Ralafen which is contra-indicated because of ulcers’)

TeRP: A test has revealed some medical problem (eg, ‘an echocardiogram revealed a pericardial effusion’)

TeCP: A test was performed to investigate a medical problem (eg, ‘chest x-ray done to rule out pneumonia’)

PIP: Two problems are related to each other (eg, ‘Azotemia presumed secondary to sepsis’)

## How to use

Use as part of an nlp pipeline with the following stages: DocumentAssembler, SentenceDetector, Tokenizer, WordEmbeddingsModel, PerceptronModel, NerDLModel, NerConverter, DependencyParserModel, RelationExtractionModel.

The precision of the RE model is controlled by "setMaxSyntacticDistance(4)", which sets the maximum syntactic distance between named entities to 4. A larger value will improve recall at the expense at lower precision.

```python


clinical_re_Model = RelationExtractionModel()\
    .pretrained("re_clinical", "en", 'clinical/models')\
    .setInputCols(["embeddings", "pos_tags", "ner_chunks", "dependencies"])\
    .setOutputCol("relations")\
    .setMaxSyntacticDistance(4)\
    .setRelationPairs(["problem-test", "problem-treatment"]) # Possible relation pairs. Default is all relations.

loaded_pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[clinical_re_Model])

empty_data = spark.createDataFrame([[""]]).toDF("text")

loaded_model = loaded_pipeline.fit(empty_data)

loaded_lmodel = LightPipeline(loaded_model)

annotations = loaded_lmodel.fullAnnotate(text)

rel_df = get_relations_df (annotations)
